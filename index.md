## This is me!

I am a * *second-year* * **Computer Engineering** major at UCSD.


One of my favorite quotes is as follows:
> You donâ€™t become confident by shouting affirmations in the mirror, but by having a stack of undeniable proof that you are who you say you are. 
> Outwork your self-doubt.
> -- Alex Hormozi


## Code

Here's some cool C code:
```C
char* easy_str_copy(char* dest, char* src) {
    while (*dest++ = *src++); // This can do the job if the destination buffer is large enough!
}
```


My proudest personal project is [ChessBot](https://github.com/yuvasaro/chess), a Chess Discord bot with a built-in AI!
